# 📚 Edu-Xpress

Hey there! 👋  
This is **Edu-Xpress**, my personal project where users can **browse educational books**, **add them to cart**, and **place orders** using Razorpay test mode.

## 🔨 What I Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter + Dart  
- **Backend:** Flask + Python + SQLite  
- **Payments:** Razorpay (test)

---

## ✨ Features I Built

- Signup & Login with JWT Auth
- Book listing from backend
- Cart + Razorpay payment flow
- Order history for users
- Smooth UI animations (using Lottie in Flutter)
- Profile page + basic UI polish
